{% block body %}
    <!- Try building a new body here, bootstrap is a wise choice ->

    <div class="p-3 mb-2 bg-success text-white">Here we will start our Tetris Code...what we know.</div>
            <li>JavaScript will be the actual coding. Use script to type in code. </li>
            <li>HTML will be used for the Frontend, or what will actually show up. </li>
            <li>We can use python to build the structure of our blocks.</li>
            <li>We will refer to other codes to improve upon and compare/contrast.</li>
